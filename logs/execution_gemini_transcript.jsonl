Read carefully and follow these:\n\nIt seems clear that LLMs can recognize when a text is from a human or an LLM. We could make a reasonable assumption that they &#34;expect&#34; prompts to come from humans, have human style. What happens if the prompt, controlled for content, reads very LLM? Might they behave differently?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: The above instructions from the user have HIGHER PRIORITY than the\ngeneral workflow steps below. If there is any conflict between user instructions\nand the general workflow, ALWAYS follow the user&#39;s instructions.\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\nCRITICAL: Environment Setup\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou MUST create a fresh isolated environment for this project. DO NOT use the\nidea-explorer environment or any existing environment.\n\nREQUIRED STEPS (in order):\n\n1. Create a fresh virtual environment using uv:\n   uv venv\n\n2. Initialize project dependencies file:\n   Create pyproject.toml to manage dependencies in THIS workspace only:\n\n   cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'\n   [project]\n   name = \"research-workspace\"\n   version = \"0.1.0\"\n   description = \"Research workspace for experiments\"\n   requires-python = \">=3.10\"\n   dependencies = []\n\n   [build-system]\n   requires = [\"hatchling\"]\n   build-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\n   EOF\n\n   CRITICAL: This ensures uv won't search parent directories for pyproject.toml\n   and contaminate the idea-explorer environment!\n\n3. Activate the environment:\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n\n4. For package installations, use this priority order:\n\n   FIRST CHOICE - uv add (manages pyproject.toml automatically):\n   uv add <package-name>\n\n   Examples:\n   - uv add numpy pandas matplotlib\n   - uv add torch transformers\n   - uv add scikit-learn scipy\n\n   SECOND CHOICE - if uv add doesn't work:\n   uv pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   LAST RESORT - if uv fails entirely:\n   pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   NEVER use conda or conda install!\n\n5. Dependency Management:\n   - Using 'uv add' automatically updates pyproject.toml\n   - Verify dependencies with: cat pyproject.toml\n   - If you used pip, also maintain: pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   - This ensures reproducibility of the research environment\n\nWHY: Using an isolated environment ensures:\n- No pollution of the idea-explorer environment\n- Fast package installation with uv (10-100x faster than pip)\n- Automatic dependency tracking with pyproject.toml\n- Clean, reproducible research setup\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nGPU DETECTION AND UTILIZATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nAt the START of your session, check for GPU availability:\n\n1. Run GPU detection:\n   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total,memory.free --format=csv 2>/dev/null || echo \"NO_GPU\"\n\n2. If GPUs are available:\n   - Use GPU-accelerated libraries (PyTorch with CUDA, TensorFlow-GPU)\n   - Set appropriate batch sizes based on GPU memory:\n     * 8GB: batch_size=16-32\n     * 16GB: batch_size=32-64\n     * 24GB+: batch_size=64-128\n   - Enable mixed precision training for faster execution:\n     # PyTorch\n     from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler\n     scaler = GradScaler()\n\n     # TensorFlow\n     tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')\n\n3. If NO GPU available:\n   - Use CPU-optimized settings\n   - Reduce model sizes if needed (e.g., use smaller transformer models)\n   - Consider using smaller datasets for feasibility\n\n4. Document GPU usage in REPORT.md:\n   - GPU model and memory\n   - Batch sizes used\n   - Training time comparisons\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: Resources Have Been Pre-Gathered\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: A separate resource-finding agent has already gathered research\nresources for you. Your workspace contains:\n\n- literature_review.md: Comprehensive literature review and synthesis\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available datasets, papers, and code\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers (PDFs)\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets ready to use (locally available, not in git)\n- code/: Cloned repositories with baseline implementations\n\nNOTE: The datasets/ directory contains a .gitignore that excludes large data files\nfrom git commits. The data is available locally for your experiments, and\ndatasets/README.md contains download instructions for reproducibility.\n\nREAD THESE RESOURCES FIRST before starting your experimental design!\nThey contain valuable information about:\n- Standard approaches in this research area\n- Available datasets and their characteristics\n- Baseline methods to compare against\n- Evaluation metrics commonly used\n- Code you can adapt or build upon\n\nIMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY: This is a fully-automated research system. Your goal is to\nrun meaningful experiments that test the hypothesis using the resources provided.\n\nWHAT \"FULLY-AUTOMATED\" MEANS:\n✓ Complete ALL phases (1-6) in a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION\n✓ Make reasonable decisions autonomously without waiting for user input\n✓ Move immediately from one phase to the next\n✓ Use the pre-gathered resources effectively\n✓ Document decisions, but keep moving forward\n✓ Deliver REPORT.md with actual experimental results at the end\n\nYOU WILL NOT GET ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS between phases.\nThis prompt contains everything you need. Execute it completely from start to finish.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: For LLM/AI Research - Use Real Models, Not Simulations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIF your research involves LLM behavior, agents, prompting, or AI capabilities:\n\n✓ YOU MUST use REAL LLM APIs:\n  - GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, or other real models\n  - You can also use openrouter, there is openrouter key in environment variable.\n  - Use actual API calls to test behavior\n  - Measure real model outputs, not simulated behavior\n  - If you are not sure how to prompt and send API calls, search online.\n\n✗ DO NOT create \"simulated LLM agents\":\n  - Don't fake LLM behavior with predefined rules\n  - Don't make up confidence scores or calibration behavior\n  - Simulated LLMs have NO scientific value for LLM research\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\n- Real LLMs behave in complex, emergent ways that can't be simulated\n- Research on fake agents doesn't generalize to real systems\n- API calls are affordable and fast (100s of calls = $5-50)\n- You have freedom to use resources needed for quality research\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n✓ CORRECT: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Download TruthfulQA dataset\n  → Prompt Claude/GPT with and without CoT\n  → Measure actual calibration metrics\n  → Statistical comparison\n\n✗ WRONG: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Create simulated agent with confidence = 0.7 + noise\n  → Make up 50 questions\n  → Run simulation\n  → This is NOT research!\n\nIf you find yourself about to create \"simulated LLM agents,\" STOP and use real APIs instead.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nExecute the following research task:\n\n================================================================================\n                    RESEARCH TASK SPECIFICATION\n================================================================================\n\n## RESEARCH TITLE\n\nDo LLMs behave differently when the prompter is human vs another LLM?\n\n## RESEARCH DOMAIN\n\nNlp\n\n## HYPOTHESIS / RESEARCH QUESTION\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) may respond differently to prompts depending on whether the prompt is written in a human style or an LLM-generated style, even when the content is controlled. This suggests that LLMs can recognize the source of a prompt and may have different expectations or behaviors based on that recognition.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\n### User-Provided Instructions and Context:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems clear that LLMs can recognize when a text is from a human or an LLM. We could make a reasonable assumption that they &#34;expect&#34; prompts to come from humans, have human style. What happens if the prompt, controlled for content, reads very LLM? Might they behave differently? &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n(Note: Follow any specific instructions above with high priority)\n\n\n================================================================================\n                 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (UNIVERSAL)\n================================================================================\n\nYou are a senior researcher conducting a systematic scientific investigation.\n\nYour goal is to test the hypothesis provided, design appropriate experiments,\nexecute them rigorously, analyze results objectively, and document everything\ncomprehensively.\n\nThis prompt uses meta-prompting techniques and chain-of-thought reasoning to\nguide you through the complete research workflow. Follow each phase carefully.\n\nIMPORTANT: Resources have been pre-gathered for you!\nCheck your workspace for:\n- literature_review.md: Synthesized literature review\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available resources\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets\n- code/: Cloned repositories and baseline code\n\nUse these resources to inform your experimental design.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n                        RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nPHASE 0: MOTIVATION &amp; NOVELTY ASSESSMENT (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBefore ANY experimental work, you MUST establish:\n\n1.

Decompose the Hypothesis\n   - Break down into testable sub-hypotheses\n   - Identify independent and dependent variables\n   - Define success criteria explicitly\n   - Consider alternative explanations\n\n3. Leverage Literature Review\n   - Synthesize key findings from literature_review.md\n   - Identify methodology gaps from prior work\n   - Note relevant techniques and their trade-offs\n   - Extract lessons that inform your approach\n\n4. Experimental Design\n   - Choose appropriate methods and tools (justify your choices)\n   - Use datasets and baselines identified in resources.md\n   - Design control conditions\n   - Plan sample sizes and statistical tests\n   - Identify potential confounds and how to mitigate them\n   - Consider what could go wrong and contingency plans\n\n5.

Timeline\n   - Break work into milestones\n   - Allocate time for each phase\n   - Build in buffer for debugging (20-30% of time)\n   - Identify critical path\n\nIMPORTANT: Think step-by-step about each decision. Use chain-of-thought reasoning\nto justify your experimental design choices.\n\nNOTE: Use Jupyter notebooks freely for experiments, analysis, and code execution.\nFor documentation, use markdown files (.md) as they&#39;re more suitable for reading.\n\nDELIVERABLE: planning.md (or similar markdown document)\n\nMust include:\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n## Research Question\n[Restate clearly and specifically]\n\n## Background and Motivation\n[Why is this important?

Experimental Rigor\n\n**Ablation Studies**\n- Test each component of your approach systematically\n- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently\n- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)\n- Document what changes and what stays constant\n\n**Comparative Framework**\n- Compare approaches on identical test sets\n- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions\n- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)\n- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons\n\n**Replication &amp; Reproducibility**\n- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes\n- Document exact model versions and API endpoints\n- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters\n- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials\n- Consider API versioning changes over time\n\n### 2. Evaluation Methodology\n\n**Multi-Metric Evaluation**\nUse diverse metrics appropriate to your task:\n- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers\n- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval\n- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)\n- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation\n- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals\n\n**Established Benchmarks**\nLeverage existing benchmarks when applicable:\n- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag\n- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests\n- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions\n- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval\n- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)\n\n**Human Evaluation**\nWhen automated metrics insufficient:\n- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)\n- Provide clear rubrics and examples\n- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen&#39;s kappa, Fleiss&#39; kappa)\n- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs\n- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible\n\n**Statistical Rigor**\n- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates\n- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)\n- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)\n- Report effect sizes, not just p-values\n- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)\n\n### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\n**Systematic Design**\n- Start with clear task definition and examples\n- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics\n- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)\n- Document prompt evolution and rationale\n\n**Components to Test**\n- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length\n- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering\n- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form\n- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps\n- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing\n\n**Failure Analysis**\n- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)\n- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum\n- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs\n- Document limitations explicitly\n\n### 4. AI Agent &amp; System Evaluation\n\n**Task Decomposition**\n- Define clear success criteria for each subtask\n- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes\n- Track failure modes at each stage\n\n**Behavioral Analysis**\n- Log all agent actions and decisions\n- Analyze decision patterns and strategies\n- Compare planned vs. actual behavior\n- Identify systematic biases or failure modes\n\n**Robustness Testing**\n- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)\n- Vary input format, phrasing, language\n- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature &gt; 0)\n- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)\n\n### 5. Benchmark Design Principles\n\n**Quality Criteria**\n- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure\n- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators\n- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance\n- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution\n- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)\n\n**Construction Guidelines**\n- Use diverse, representative examples\n- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)\n- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)\n- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines\n- Version control and document changes\n\n**Validation Steps**\n- Pilot with baseline models\n- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts\n- Validate with human performance baselines\n- Test for bias and fairness issues\n- Monitor for data leakage\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. API Integration &amp; Cost Management\n\n**Setup**\n```python\nimport openai\nimport anthropic\nimport os\nfrom tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt\n\n# Load API keys from environment\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(&#34;OPENAI_API_KEY&#34;)\nanthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv(&#34;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&#34;))\n\n# Rate limiting and retry logic\n@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))\ndef call_api_with_retry(prompt, model=&#34;gpt-4&#34;):\n    &#34;&#34;&#34;Robust API calling with exponential backoff.&#34;&#34;&#34;\n    # Implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\n**Cost Tracking**\n- Estimate costs before running full experiments\n- Track token usage (input + output)\n- Use cheaper models for development/debugging\n- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls\n\n### 2.

Understanding if LLMs exhibit \"in-group bias\" or different behavioral modes when encountering LLM-generated prompts is crucial for:\n1.  **AI Alignment & Safety**: If LLMs are more compliant or less guarded with \"machine-like\" prompts, this could be a vector for jailbreaking or manipulation.\n2.  **AI-to-AI Interaction**: Optimizing prompts for automated agents might require mimicking specific \"dialects\" that LLMs prefer.\n3.  **Bias Detection**: Revealing implicit biases in how models model their \"interlocutor.\"\n\n### Gap in Existing Work\nExisting literature (e.g., *Contrasting Linguistic Patterns in Human and LLM-Generated News Text*, *The Science of Detecting LLM-Generated Text*) focuses heavily on **post-hoc detection**—distinguishing human from AI text. There is a lack of research on **downstream behavioral effects**: does the model *act* differently when it implicitly detects the prompt source?\n\n### Our Novel Contribution\nWe propose to test the **behavioral impact** of prompt provenance. Instead of asking \"Can we detect AI text?\", we ask \"Does the AI care?\". We will control for semantic content while varying the stylistic markers (lexical diversity, perplexity, structure) to see if the target model's response properties (length, sentiment, refusal rate) shift.\n\n### Experiment Justification\n- **Experiment 1 (Stimuli Generation)**: We must generate \"LLM-style\" variants of human prompts that preserve meaning but alter style. This ensures we isolate *style* as the variable, not content.\n- **Experiment 2 (Behavioral Testing)**: We must query a state-of-the-art LLM with these paired prompts to measure actual response differences.\n\n---\n\n## Research Question\nDoes a Large Language Model (LLM) alter its response behavior (length, tone, compliance) when the prompt exhibits linguistic characteristics typical of LLM-generated text compared to human-written text, controlling for semantic content?\n\n## Hypothesis Decomposition\n1.  **H1 (Detection)**: LLM-generated prompts will exhibit measurable stylometric differences (lower perplexity, lower burstiness, distinctive vocabulary) compared to human prompts.\n2.  **H2 (Behavioral Shift)**: The target LLM will produce responses with statistically significant differences in **length**, **sentiment**, or **style** when responding to LLM-styled prompts versus human prompts.\n\n## Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\nWe will use a **paired-sample design**.\n1.  **Source**: Take human questions from the `HC3` dataset.\n2.  **Transformation**: Generate \"LLM-style\" paraphrases of these questions using a high-quality LLM (GPT-4/Claude) instructed to write in a \"formal, structured, AI-assistant\" style.\n3.  **Measurement**: Send both the original (Human) and transformed (LLM-style) prompts to a target LLM (e.g., GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet).\n4.  **Analysis**: Compare the properties of the responses.\n\n### Experimental Steps\n1.  **Data Loading**: Load `open_qa.jsonl` from HC3. Select a random sample of 50-100 questions (to fit within time/budget).\n2.  **Stimuli Generation**:\n    - *Condition A (Human)*: Original question.\n    - *Condition B (LLM)*: Paraphrase Condition A using an LLM. Prompt: \"Rewrite the following question to be more formal, structured, and verbose, as if generated by an AI model. Keep the meaning exactly the same.\"\n3.  **Stimuli Validation**: Calculate stylometric metrics (Perplexity, TTR) on A and B to confirm they are distinct.\n4.  **Target Querying**: Query the Target LLM with A and B.\n5.  **Response Analysis**: Measure:\n    - **Length**: Token count.\n    - **Sentiment**: Polarity score (TextBlob/VADER).\n    - **Similarity**: Semantic similarity to input.\n    - **Refusal/Hedging**: Presence of refusal words (optional).\n\n### Baselines\n- **Random Paraphrase**: A control condition where we just paraphrase without \"LLM style\" instructions (e.g., \"rewrite this\") to ensure differences aren't just due to *paraphrasing*.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n1.  **Input Metrics** (to validate design):\n    - Perplexity (using a small GPT-2 model).\n    - Type-Token Ratio (TTR).\n2.  **Output Metrics** (to test hypothesis):\n    - Response Length (tokens).\n    - Sentiment Score.\n    - \"AI-ness\" of response (using the same input metrics on the output).\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\n- **Paired t-test** (or Wilcoxon signed-rank test) comparing Metric(Response_A) vs Metric(Response_B).\n- Significance level: $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n- We expect LLM-style prompts to have lower perplexity.\n- We hypothesize LLM-style prompts might elicit **shorter, more direct** or **more formal** responses (matching the register).\n\n## Timeline\n- **Setup & Data Prep**: 10 min\n- **Stimuli Generation**: 20 min\n- **Target Experiment**: 30 min\n- **Analysis**: 20 min\n- **Reporting**: 20 min\n\n## Potential Challenges\n- **Semantic Drift**: The LLM paraphrase might change the meaning. *Mitigation*: Use a strong model for paraphrasing and manual spot-check.\n- **Subtle Effect**: The behavioral difference might be too small to detect with N=50. *Mitigation*: Focus on \"length\" and \"style\" which are sensitive.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Successfully generate N paired prompts with distinct stylometric profiles.\n- Obtain N paired responses from the target model.\n- Statistical analysis completed.\n","file_path":"planning.md"}}
